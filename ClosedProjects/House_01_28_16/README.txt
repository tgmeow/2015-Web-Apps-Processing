This program draws a nice little house that rotates around the sun. The rotation speed depends on the x mouse location.

The house is made of a triangular roof, and rectangular windows, body, and door.
There are two trees on the side made of an ellipse and a rectangle.
The sun is made up of a gradient of colors and randomly shakes.

On my honor I did not give or receive unauthorized assistance on this assignment.
